Workflow DevKit provides first-class support for building durable AI agents through the `@workflow/ai` package. This package integrates with the [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev) to provide production-ready agent primitives.

## Guide

For a complete walkthrough of building AI agents with Workflow DevKit, see the **[Building Durable AI Agents](/guides/ai-agents)** guide, which covers:

- Converting AI SDK agents to durable agents
- Implementing resumable streams
- Adding sleep and scheduling capabilities
- Human-in-the-loop approval patterns
